Driven by my determination to master the craft, I've embarked on a journey to learn various programming languages, frameworks, and design principles. From HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to libraries like React and backend technologies like Node.js, I'm constantly expanding my skill set to stay ahead in this fast-paced industry.

Living in the bustling metropolis of New York City fuels my creativity and exposes me to a diverse range of cultures and perspectives. I find inspiration in the city's energy and use it to infuse uniqueness into my projects.
